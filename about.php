      <p>Iâ€™m a Web Developer who works with some of the most advanced web technologies on the internet today. Some but not all of the skills that I have for developing for the web are, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript , PHP and ASP.NET/C#.<br>

      Beginning from when I was a child I have been interested in Technology, specifically the internet. The internet is a beautiful place, this is because of designers. If there were no designers like myself with a passion for the Internet then life would be so very different, we would still be looking at plain text on a screen without design or functionality.<br>

      The internet has come a long way in a relatively short time and I am proud to be a part of that ever changing and developing world which not only changes lives with research and information but socially and entertaining as well.<br>
      
      I hope to have a long and interesting career working for a company that has a broad vision and wants to be a leader in the changes that the internet is bound see in the future. There is no feeling like seeing the changes that you make help and shape lives on the internet.</p>
