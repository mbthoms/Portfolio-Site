The biggest thing about the internet is that you can post anything you want, what you want, anytime and anywhere you want. Now this said. I would love to have a blog for everything, but let's be real... Blogs always have a main focus... and that focus will have to be a new one for me.

As you may know I'm a Web Design Student at the time of writing this and I should have started with blog a long time ago. For some reason I didn't think that I would have needed a blog or even thought that I have anything to share that would be worth reading / seeing.

What I'm trying to get at it. Like many people on sites like YouTube that make some of their living off of or all (depending on what happens to their channels) had to start from somewhere.

I would love to start here. With this blog, I think that would be a great way to start. So I'm going to start by saying hello and tell a bit about myself.

Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Matthew Thoms a Web Design Student from Southern Ontario, Canada. I love to talk about anything that is tech related. Gaming is a big part of my life also. Ever since I was a child I've been into Technology.

The internet was what I really found the most interesting. I remember creating Piczo sites (Piczo was a website builder from the early 2000's). I loved making them, I found is fascinating that I could make something show up on the internet and have it say there no matter what computer I was on.

Now here I am, in college to become a web designer. to gain the knowledge to design and create for the web and the internet as a whole.

Have a great day,

Matthew Thoms
