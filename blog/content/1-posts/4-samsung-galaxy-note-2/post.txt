Android is from Google, therefor they should have google products at the front line connecting all their services to the phone to get productivity done easily and efficiently. Well you would think that would be the case but it really isn’t for Samsung phones. Samsung seems like they want to keep the phone personalized to their company it seems. I would like to see if Samsung would make a phone that has stock Android on it.

# Build Quality and Size
The Samsung Note 2’s build quality is okay for a phone, well at least putting it up against a phone like an iPhone. The Note 2 has its advantages and disadvantages like any smartphone for that matter. The film is made out of plastic mostly but there is glass for the screen. Most android phones are usually made of plastic anyways with the exception of some smartphones. The main reason to use plastic instead of Materials like metal is because it’s cheap light and they can make it any colour they want for less money and painting metal.

The Note 2 is quite big for the with the average person’s hand. For Six months I’ve had the phone I almost dropped it about a dozen times, made even more you lose count after a while. That’s why I got an OtterBox Case for it. The case makes it bigger but I would rather it a little bigger then broken if it hits the ground. I bet I’m not the only one with that thought. The Note 2 is a small phone if you want a thin phone, but that is normal now-a-days with all the phones becoming smaller widths and bigger screens. The Note 2 pen also fits into the phone at the bottom right in it’s own slot. The phone can detect if the pen is in or out of the phone as well.

# Operating System
The operating system being an Android phone it originally came with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) but as the years go on the phone had a few upgrades in the terms of software as now it currently runs Android 4.4.2 (Kit Kat). Samsung likes to make there phones a little different with the software because they give the user some main applications to use with the phones hardware. For example, the bigger screen allows them to have two applications running at the same time side by side. Also with the pen that the Note 2 has you can use the calendar application to make marks, set appointments, make the calendar your own. It’s like having a paper calendar, you can write all over it if you wanted to.

# Camera
The Camera is a great camera for photos outdoors. It lacks low-light capabilities as it takes grainy photos in low light. The camera on a phone is usually not the main feature of a phone but now-a-days it is with everything taking photos of themselves (aka selfies). I’m not one for using the front facing camera on a phone other then using for Skype or some sort of video chat. But for all the cameras that are on phones, the front facing ones are the worst quality for some reason. This phone is no different in that aspect. I would like to see better cameras on the front facing side of the device for video chats taking photos and doing anything else with the camera you want to do.

# Final Thoughts
The phone is a great phone for people that wants a phone that they can see well, the phone has a larger text size due to the size of the screen. The battery lasts all day and then some and from someone that uses their phone all day and everyday and the screen is always on. It is one of the best phones for battery from 2012.
