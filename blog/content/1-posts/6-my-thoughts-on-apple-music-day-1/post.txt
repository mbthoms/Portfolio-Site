# Little Information about the Service
Apple Music has been announced at WWDC 15 (World Wide Web Developer Conference 2015) this year. Apple Music is going to be lunching on June 30th 2015. Everyone can have access to the brand new service for 3 months for free.

Apple Music isn’t just about the music streaming, it’s about giving a place for artists to upload and share their art with the world.

> Your music lives in one place. And every place.
-Apple

Apple Music has built one place for you to have all the music anywhere you want. The only thing is, that is not new, Spotify, Pandora Radio and other streaming services have had that for years. The one thing that they haven’t had for years is the fact that the artists can now have the choice to upload and share everything from photos and sound bits to videos etc. In the one place that you have your music, Instead of having it on other social media sites like (link: http://facebook.com/ text: Facebook), (link: http://instagram.com/ text: Instagram) and (link: http://twitter.com/ text: Twitter).

# Beats 1 Radio
Beats 1 Radio is a station that is always on. It’s an internet radio station. The hosts for the station are 3 people who are from all around the world. The 3 people are:

- Zane Lowe in Los Angeles
- Ebro Darden in New York
- Julie Adenuga in London

This Video is a recap from Apple themselves about their service.

# Onto my Thoughts
I found the 3-month trial kind of nice, as I use other music streaming services everyday and would like to try Apple Music to see if it is worth using. The one I use a lot is Spotify. I use their free version with ad-supported music streaming. I don’t mind the ads in between some of my songs. Ads between the songs are kind of nice in some cases because it breaks up the constant music. Other times it’s really not that great when you want to listen to songs back to back.

What I like to do is use the music streaming services to listen to my favorite music when I work on any kind of work that needs me to be focused for quite a long period of time.

The Beats 1 radio seems like a great idea. I would love to have a station that is always on and ready to stream. I’m really into the latest music, the number 1 charts so I think I will enjoy this station.

# Final Thought
My final thought about this service is, because I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 4s I think I will be able to have the streaming service everywhere I go and this is a good thing.

I will update my thoughts on the service once Apple has launched the service to the public.
