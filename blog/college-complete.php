        As of today, August 20, 2016 I have completed college. This is something that I will look back on in the future. I had picked Web Design/Development because I loved to web. What I first thought was that I wasnâ€™t going to be good at the coding part of the website design process. But man I was wrong... That is my favorite part of the process. <br>
